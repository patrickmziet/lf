Archie and his conceited rival Reggie battle for\\nthe affections of Betty and Veronica, and the two girls, though they are best\\nfriends, jockey for the attention of Archie, the affable  all- American boy. They\\nhave been at it for more than 60 years, and in the early days the basic situation\\nwasn\\u2019t far removed from the experience of many Americans, especially in\\nsmall towns. Indeed, cartoonist Bob Montana based the Archie characters on\\npeople he knew from his high school days during the 1930s in Haverhill,\\nMassachusetts. Most romantic competition occurred within small groups of\\npeople who knew one another. The girl or guy would choose, perhaps the\\ncouple would marry and settle down, and often the loser ended up living down\\nthe street or across town. Romance was full of heartbreak and anxiety, but at\\nleast you knew who your rivals were and who was beating  you.\\nArchie and his crowd continue their antics in the world of colored ink, but in\\nthe real world, romantic competition has radically changed. Millions of Women\\nAre Waiting to Meet You is the apt title of Sean Thomas\\u2019s 2006 book about\\nInternet dating, and there really are, just as millions of men are now potential\\nmatches for each woman. But the sad truth for members of both sexes is that\\nmillions of rivals are also waiting, waiting to undercut their chances and crush\\ntheir hopes before they even get close to a first date. All they will \\u201csee\\u201d is that\\ntheir charming e-mail to \\u201cprettyblonde47\\u201d or \\u201cbronc0451\\u201d was never answered.\\nThe competition now is invisible, the rivals  faceless.\\nWhat\\u2019s true in the romantic sphere is also increasingly the case in the wider\\nworld.

No rival with\\nsnarling teeth knocks on your  door.\\nAny good horror-movie director knows that invisibility increases anxiety. We\\nall want to turn on the light, identify the assailant, or understand the problem\\nwe are facing. If we cannot, we clutch at straws. We look for order, even when\\norder cannot be found; this is a theme of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of the\\nbest-selling books The Black Swan (2007) and Fooled by Randomness (2005). As\\nthe concrete manifestations of the more important contests of love and\\nbusiness vanish, we recreate  up- close rivalry to make our lives feel more real. I\\nsuspect that this helps explain the growing appetite for televised sports and\\norganized athletics for children as well as the vogue for reality TV series such\\nas Survivor and American Idol, eating contests, and even spelling bees. Because\\nchildren are a cheap labor supply and willing to engage in all sorts of behavior\\nfor a chance at a prize or parental approval, they often serve as the vehicle for\\nparents who seek to live out their desire for  head- to- head competition\\nvicariously. Spelling does not interest many people (who sits around\\npracticing?), but bees exemplify the competitive spirit in action. The challenge\\nto spell autochthonous, panmyelo pathy, or warison will bring one kid to tears\\nand another to  triumph.\\nMore significantly, anxiety about invisible competition also feeds the backlash\\nagainst international trade. Economists are right to stress that the benefits of\\ntrade outweigh the costs, most of all to Bangladeshis but also to American\\nconsumers, yet an increasingly disquieted public demands more proof. A\\nmeasure of reassurance can found by sorting through the winners and losers\\n\\n        Make 10 flash cards.\\n    \"\n",

Archie and his conceited rival Reggie battle for\\nthe affections of Betty and Veronica, and the two girls, though they are best\\nfriends, jockey for the attention of Archie, the affable  all- American boy. They\\nhave been at it for more than 60 years, and in the early days the basic situation\\nwasn’t far removed from the experience of many Americans, especially in\\nsmall towns. Indeed, cartoonist Bob Montana based the Archie characters on\\npeople he knew from his high school days during the 1930s in Haverhill,\\nMassachusetts. Most romantic competition occurred within small groups of\\npeople who knew one another. The girl or guy would choose, perhaps the\\ncouple would marry and settle down, and often the loser ended up living down\\nthe street or across town. Romance was full of heartbreak and anxiety, but at\\nleast you knew who your rivals were and who was beating  you.\\nArchie and his crowd continue their antics in the world of colored ink, but in\\nthe real world, romantic competition has radically changed. Millions of Women\\nAre Waiting to Meet You is the apt title of Sean Thomas’s 2006 book about\\nInternet dating, and there really are, just as millions of men are now potential\\nmatches for each woman. But the sad truth for members of both sexes is that\\nmillions of rivals are also waiting, waiting to undercut their chances and crush\\ntheir hopes before they even get close to a first date. All they will “see” is that\\ntheir charming e-mail to “prettyblonde47” or “bronc0451” was never answered.\\nThe competition now is invisible, the rivals  faceless.\\nWhat’s true in the romantic sphere is also increasingly the case in the wider\\nworld. Most of the pressure on the wages and job security of American\\nsoftware programmers now comes from eager workers in India and\\n\\n        Make 10 flash cards.\\n    '}],\n",

No rival with\\nsnarling teeth knocks on your  door.\\nAny good horror-movie director knows that invisibility increases anxiety. We\\nall want to turn on the light, identify the assailant, or understand the problem\\nwe are facing. If we cannot, we clutch at straws. We look for order, even when\\norder cannot be found; this is a theme of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of the\\nbest-selling books The Black Swan (2007) and Fooled by Randomness (2005). As\\nthe concrete manifestations of the more important contests of love and\\nbusiness vanish, we recreate  up- close rivalry to make our lives feel more real. I\\nsuspect that this helps explain the growing appetite for televised sports and\\norganized athletics for children as well as the vogue for reality TV series such\\nas Survivor and American Idol, eating contests, and even spelling bees. Because\\nchildren are a cheap labor supply and willing to engage in all sorts of behavior\\nfor a chance at a prize or parental approval, they often serve as the vehicle for\\nparents who seek to live out their desire for  head- to- head competition\\nvicariously. Spelling does not interest many people (who sits around\\npracticing?), but bees exemplify the competitive spirit in action. The challenge\\nto spell autochthonous, panmyelo pathy, or warison will bring one kid to tears\\nand another to  triumph.\\nMore significantly, anxiety about invisible competition also feeds the backlash\\nagainst international trade. Economists are right to stress that the benefits of\\ntrade outweigh the costs, most of all to Bangladeshis but also to American\\nconsumers, yet an increasingly disquieted public demands more proof. A\\nmeasure of reassurance can found by sorting through the winners and losers\\n\\n        Make 10 flash cards.\\n    '}]]"
